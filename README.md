# WooDevOps
DevOps platform for WooCommerce

WooCommerce and WordPress have not been created with professional development workflows in mind. However, roughly half of webshops today are built on WooCommerce, including those with thousands (even tens of thousands) of products and significant traffic.
There is a real demand from WooCommerce developers and maintainers to be able to develop securely and professionally.

In this project, we aim to
  * Support staging and production environments.
  * Create automated product and order migration between environments.
  * Implement CI/CD pipelines.
